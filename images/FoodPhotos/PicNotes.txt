The majority of the pictures provided to us have proven rather useless, and so

Notes for how pics should be taken next time:

- We need pictures of things by themselves so they don't imply that they come with anything
- When things are together, they still need to have a place on the website. So soda should not be photographed with alcohol etc.
- Everything needs to be in frame. Part of a food or drink (including things like straws) should not be left out
- For certain foods like El Cubano, we need closer-up pictures to really show the ingredients. Not just show that it's a sandwich as it shows now.
- Above all, focus on the images selling our food, not just looking good (the image with the sodas and the cocktails looks good, but there's nowhere I would use it. And as it's the only photo that used the piña colada, it was a waste of a piña colada. Same goes for the photo of the Mojito and the Summer Breeze which also had the mango milkshake)
